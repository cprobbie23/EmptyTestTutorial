1. As a user, when navigating to the home page, I want to see a list of users
	--Acceptace criteria--
	* I am on the main page
	* I can see a table of users
	* The table is populated
	* The table has values for all columns
	* The table is constrained to show the first 20 users	

2. As a user, when looking at the users table, I want to save a user in a cookie
	This would be an action for modifying and saving a user in the DB. Instead
	we will not modify them and save them in a cookie. This story is to demonstrate 
	what happens when we don't have specific code output. Can't e2e this either.
	--Acceptace criteria--
	* I can save a user
